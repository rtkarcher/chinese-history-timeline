Built using [TimelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) and drawing historical information from dozens of academic institutions, museums, libraries, and gallery resources, I aim to create a comprehensive, interactive timeline of ancient Chinese history. 

Once the historical captions, aesthetic and historic imagery are in place, I want to start plotting transparent polygonal cartographic overlays depicting the territory held during each period of dynastic rule (Javascript/Google Maps API): [http://jsfiddle.net/quizas/so8hf3r4/](http://jsfiddle.net/quizas/so8hf3r4/)

Map coordinate plotting instructions (also very rough/still in progress!) [can be found here](http://rainerkarcher.com/mapping.php).

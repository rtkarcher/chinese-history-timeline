From the Neolithic Age to the Present

[Timeline Demo (still in progress)](http://rainerkarcher.com/js/timeline-js/history.php)


While looking around for a comprehensive visual guide to Chinese history, I found that most study materials available were static (printer-friendly!) time tables, but I was disappointed to find little in the way of interactive timelines. With that in mind, I set out to create one using [TimelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/), sourcing my historical information from dozens of academic resources and secondary sources (courtesy of several individuals and institutions, all of whom I try to credit as transparently as possible). This is a work in progress, but ultimately, I'd like to create a broad overview that can be useful for anyone wanting to learn more about China's dynastic history.

I'm also working on some cartographic regional overlays for each of the pre-Republican periods using the Google Maps API: [http://jsfiddle.net/quizas/so8hf3r4/](http://jsfiddle.net/quizas/so8hf3r4/)
